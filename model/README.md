# CNN Model Implementation 

Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network to brain tumor RMI classification. Images are resized to speed up the training process. 

The propossed model layers are (**Modify with the final model**): 

Conv2D + MaxPool2D + Conv2D + MaxPool2D  +Conv2D + MaxPool2D + Dense  + Dense (activaci√≥n = softmax)

Hyper-parameters to explore:

* Number of filters

* Size of kernels

* Strides

* Optimizer 

* Activation functions

* Loss function 

* Number of layers

* Batch size

* Epochs
